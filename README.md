This web app was built to showcase my personal portfolio of coding projects. Technologies and libraries used so far have been HTML, CSS, Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap, FlexBox, Materialize, Jquery, Google fonts, Firebase, Ajax, various APIs, SQL/MySQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, and various NPMs. Check out the portfolio page for completed projects.

Please note that for the Pokemon Vs Marvel app you will need to download and activate CORS (linked below) and enable "unsafe" scripts in your browser. Working on updating so that these steps will not be necessary soon!
